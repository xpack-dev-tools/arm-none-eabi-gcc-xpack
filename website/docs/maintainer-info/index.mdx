This page is intended for those who maintain
**xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC**
and documents how to make new releases.

## Prerequisites

The build scripts run on GNU/Linux and macOS. The Windows binaries are
compiled on x64 GNU/Linux, using [mingw-w64](https://mingw-w64.org).

For details on installing the prerequisites, please read the
[XBB prerequisites page](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/prerequisites/).

## Get project sources

The project is hosted on GitHub:

- https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git

To clone the **stable** branch (`xpack`), run the following commands in a
terminal (on Windows use the _Git Bash_ console):

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git && \
git clone https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git \
  ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git
```

For **development** purposes, clone the `xpack-development` branch:

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git && \
mkdir -p ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools && \
git clone \
  --branch xpack-development \
  https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git \
  ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git
```

Or, if the repo was already cloned:

```sh
git -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git pull
```

## Get the writable helper sources

The project has a dependency to a common **helper**, that is
normally installed as a read-only dependency; for **development
purposes**, to be able to make changes to the scripts located inside the helper,
clone the `xpack-development` branch and link it to
the central xPacks store:

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git && \
mkdir -p ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools && \
git clone \
  --branchxpack-development \
  https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git \
  ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git && \
xpm link -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git
```

Or, if the repo was already cloned:

```sh
git -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git pull
xpm link -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git
```

## Prepare the new releases

Before starting the build, perform some checks and tweaks.

### Download the build scripts

The build scripts are available in the `build-assets/scripts` folder of the
[`xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack)
Git repo.

To download them on a new machine, clone the `xpack-development` branch,
as seen above.

### Check Git

In the `xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack` Git repo:

- switch to the `xpack-development` branch
- pull new changes
- if needed, merge the `xpack` branch

### Update helper & other dependencies

Check the latest versions at https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/ and
update the dependencies in `build-assets/package.json`.

<CheckUpstreamRelease/>

### Fix possible open issues

Check GitHub issues and pull requests:

- https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/issues/

and fix them; assign them to a milestone (like <code>{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }</code>).

### Increase the version and update VERSION

Determine the version (like <code>{ customField('upstreamVersion') }</code>)
and update the `build-assets/scripts/VERSION` file; the format
is <code>{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }</code>.
The fourth number is the xPack release number
of this version. A fifth number will be added to the version in `package.json`
when the package is published to the `npm` server.

### Update the version in top `package.json` to a pre-release

Use the new version, suffixed by `.pre`,
like <code>{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }.{ customField('npmSubversion') }.pre</code>.

### Start the local web server

Execute the npm script `clean` then `start` in the website sub-project,
or run the following in a terminal:

```sh
(cd ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git/website; npm run clean; npm run start)
```

Navigate to the **Maintainer Info** page,
the **Update the version specific code** section.

<UpdateVersionSpecific/>

### Update `CHANGELOG.md`

- open the `CHANGELOG.md` file
- check if all previous fixed issues are in
- add a new entry like _**\* v{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') } prepared**_
- commit with a message like _**prepare v{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }**_

### Push the changes to Git

Be sure that the latest commit that updates `VERSION` is pushed
to the `xpack-development` branch!

:::caution

This is really important, otherwise the next steps
will build again the previous release!

:::

## Run the development builds

The builds currently run on 5 dedicated machines (x64 GNU/Linux,
arm64 GNU/Linux, arm GNU/Linux, x64 macOS and arm64 macOS).

Before the real build, run test builds on all platforms.

### Visual Studio Code

All actions are defined as **xPack actions** and can be conveniently
triggered via the VS Code graphical interface, using the
[xPack extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ilg-vscode.xpack).

<Patches/>

### Restart the docker daemons

If, for any reasons, the docker builds need to be canceled, it is very
likely that some processes will continue to run in the background.

To completely terminate them, and ensure that docker runs
from a clean slate, restart the docker daemons on all GNU/Linux
machines:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Build the x64 macOS binaries

For x64 macOS, first run the build on the development machine
(`wksi`, a recent macOS):

```sh
export XBB_ENVIRONMENT_SKIP_CHECKS="y"
```

```sh
rm -f ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/package-lock.json
git -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git pull

xpm run install -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/build-assets

git -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git pull
xpm link -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git

xpm run link-deps -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/build-assets

xpm run deep-clean --config darwin-x64  -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/build-assets && \
xpm install --config darwin-x64 -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/build-assets && \
xpm run build-development --config darwin-x64 -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/build-assets
```

For a debug build:

```sh
xpm run build-development-debug --config darwin-x64 -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/build-assets
```

The build takes { durations["work"] }.

When functional, push the `xpack-development` branch to GitHub.

Run the native build on the production machine
(`xbbmi`, an older macOS);
start a VS Code remote session, or connect with a terminal:

```sh
caffeinate ssh xbbmi
```

<PlatformNativeBuild platform="darwin-x64"/>

### Build the arm64 macOS binaries

Run the native build on the production machine
(`xbbma`, an older macOS);
start a VS Code remote session, or connect with a terminal:

```sh
caffeinate ssh xbbma
```

<PlatformNativeBuild platform="darwin-arm64"/>

### Build the x64 GNU/Linux binaries

Run the docker build on the production machine (`xbbli`);
start a VS Code remote session, or connect with a terminal:

```sh
caffeinate ssh xbbli
```

<PlatformDockerBuild platform="linux-x64"/>

### Build the x64 Windows binaries

Run the docker build on the production machine (`xbbli`);
start a VS Code remote session, or connect with a terminal:

```sh
caffeinate ssh xbbli
```

<PlatformDockerBuild platform="win32-x64"/>

### Build the arm64 GNU/Linux binaries

Run the docker build on the production machine (`xbbla`);
start a VS Code remote session, or connect with a terminal:

```sh
caffeinate ssh xbbla
```

<PlatformDockerBuild platform="linux-arm64"/>

### Build the arm GNU/Linux (32-bit) binaries

Run the docker build on the production machine (`xbbla32`);
start a VS Code remote session, or connect with a terminal:

```sh
caffeinate ssh xbbla32
```

<PlatformDockerBuild platform="linux-arm"/>

### Update the trees in the Install Guide page

Copy the trees displayed at the end of the test builds and paste to
**Folder hierarchy** section in the web file:

- `website/docs/install/_miscellaneous.mdx`

Replace **{ customField('upstreamVersion') }** with
`${ customField('upstreamVersion') }` (there must be 6 occurences).

:::tip

macOS does not have a `tree` command; either compile it from
[sources](https://github.com/Old-Man-Programmer/tree), or install it
via HomeBrew, and make a link to `/usr/local/bin`.

:::

### Update the list of links in package.json

Copy/paste the full list of links displayed at the end of the build, in
sequence, for each platform (GNU/Linux, macOS, Windows), and check the
differences compared to the repository.

Commit if necessary.

### How to build a debug version

In some cases it is necessary to run a debug session with the binaries.

For these cases, the build script accepts the `--debug` options.

There are also xPack actions that use this option (`build-development-debug`
and `docker-build-development-debug`).

### Files cache

The XBB build scripts use a local cache such that files are downloaded only
during the first run, later runs being able to use the cached files.

However, occasionally some servers may not be available, and the builds
may fail.

The workaround is to manually download the files from alternate
locations (like
https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/files-cache/tree/master/libs),
place them in the XBB cache (`Work/cache`) and restart the build.

## Run the production builds

The automation is provided by GitHub Actions and three self-hosted runners.


### Start the self-hosted runners

- on the development machine (`wksi`) open ssh sessions to the build
machines (`xbbmi`, `xbbma`, `xbbli`, `xbbla` and `xbbla32`):

```sh
caffeinate ssh xbbmi
caffeinate ssh xbbma
caffeinate ssh xbbli
caffeinate ssh xbbla
caffeinate ssh xbbla32
```

Create a `screen` session, to provide a persistent standard output for
the runners:

```sh
screen -S ga
```

To quit it, use `# Ctrl-a Ctrl-d`.

For `xbbli` & `xbbla`, which have more memory, start two runners:

```sh
~/actions-runners/xpack-dev-tools/1/run.sh &
~/actions-runners/xpack-dev-tools/2/run.sh &
```

On all other machines start a single runner:

```sh
~/actions-runners/xpack-dev-tools/run.sh &
```

To check the status of the runners locally:

```sh
ps -a | grep 'Runner.Listener'
```

To kill them:

```sh
killall Runner.Listener
```

### Check the status of the runners

The status of all self-hosted runners is available at the [GitHub Runners](https://github.com/organizations/xpack-dev-tools/settings/actions/runners) page.

### Publish the helper

Publish a new release of the helper on **npmjs**.

### Update the dependency to the new helper

In `build-assets/package.json`, update the reference
to `"@xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper":`
(possibly in all xPack projects).

### Commit the changes to `build-assets/package.json`

Use the message **build-assets/package.json: bump deps**.

### Check for disk space

Check if the build machines have enough free space and eventually
do some cleanups

GNU/Linux:

```sh
df -BG -H /
```

macOS:
```
df -gH /
```

To free the space used by previous builds:

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/*/build-assets/build ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/*/build
```

### Generate the GitHub workflows

Run the **`generate-workflows`** to update the
GitHub workflow files.

### Commit and push

- commit with the message **Re-generate workflows**
- push the `xpack-dependency` branch to GitHub

### Manually trigger the build GitHub Actions

To trigger the GitHub Actions builds, use the xPack actions:

- **`trigger-workflow-build-darwin-x64`**
- **`trigger-workflow-build-darwin-arm64`**
- **`trigger-workflow-build-linux-x64`**
- **`trigger-workflow-build-win32-x64`**
- **`trigger-workflow-build-linux-arm64`**
- **`trigger-workflow-build-linux-arm`**

The scripts behind these actions require the `GITHUB_API_DISPATCH_TOKEN`
variable to be present
in the environment, and the organization `PUBLISH_TOKEN` to be visible in the
Settings → Action →
[Secrets](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/settings/secrets/actions)
page.

These commands use the `xpack-development` branch of this repo.

### Durations & resulting binaries

<GitHubActionsDurations/>

The workflow result and logs are available from the
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/actions/) page.

The resulting binaries are available for testing from
[pre-releases/test](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/pre-releases/releases/tag/test/).

## Run the tests

### Automated tests

The automation is provided by GitHub Actions.

To trigger the GitHub Actions tests, use the xPack actions:

- **`trigger-workflow-test-prime`**
- **`trigger-workflow-test-docker-linux-intel`**
- **`trigger-workflow-test-docker-linux-arm`**

The scripts behind these accesible require the `GITHUB_API_DISPATCH_TOKEN` variable to be present
in the environment.

These actions use the `xpack-development` branch of this repo and the
[pre-releases/test](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/pre-releases/releases/tag/test/)
binaries.

The tests results are available from the
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/actions/) page.

Since GitHub Actions provides a limited range of versions for the macOS
runner, the multi-version macOS tests run on Travis.

To trigger the Travis test, use the xPack action:

- **`trigger-travis-macos`**

This is equivalent to:

```sh
bash ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/build-assets/xpacks/@xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper/github-actions/trigger-travis-macos.sh
```

This script requires the `TRAVIS_COM_TOKEN` variable to be present
in the environment.

The test results are available from
[Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/builds/).

### Manual tests

To download the pre-released archive for the specific platform
and run the tests, use:

```sh
git -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git pull
xpm run install -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/build-assets
xpm run test-pre-release -C ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/build-assets
```

For even more tests, on each platform (MacOS, GNU/Linux, Windows),
download the archive from
[pre-releases/test](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/pre-releases/releases/tag/test/)
and check the binaries.

On macOS, remove the `com.apple.quarantine` flag:

```sh
xattr -cr ${HOME}/Downloads/xpack-*
```

<FunctionalTests/>

## Publish the release

### Create a new GitHub pre-release draft

- in `CHANGELOG.md`, add the release date and a message
  like _**\* v{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') } released**_
- commit with _**CHANGELOG update**_
- check and possibly update the `build-assets/templates/body-github-release-liquid.mdx`
- push the `xpack-development` branch to GitHub
- run the xPack action
  - **`trigger-workflow-publish-release`**

The workflow result and logs are available from the
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/actions/) page.

The result is a
[draft pre-release](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/releases/)
tagged like **v{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }** (mind the dash in the middle!) and
named like **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC v{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }** (mind the dash),
with all binaries attached.

- edit the draft and attach it to the `xpack-development` branch (important!)
- save the draft (do **not** publish yet!)

### Prepare a new blog post

- check and possibly update the `build-assets/templates/body-blog-release-*-liquid.md`
- run the xPack action
  - **`generate-website-blog-post`**; this will add a file
in the `website/blog` folder.
- edit the front matter properties
- select the summary

### Create the GitHub pre-release

- go to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/releases/) page
- perform the final edits and check if everything is fine
- **keep the pre-release button enabled**
- do not enable Discussions yet
- publish the release

Note: at this moment the system should send a notification to all clients
watching this project.

### Update the web install page

- check and possibly update the output of the `--version` runs in `website/docs/install/_install-*.mdx`
- commit changes

### Check the list of links in package.json

- open the `package.json` file
- check if the links in the `bin` property cover the actual binaries
- if necessary, also check on Windows

### Update the package.json list of binaries

- select the `xpack-development` branch
- run the xPack action
  - **`update-package-binaries`**
- open the top `package.json` file
- check the `baseUrl:` it should match the file URLs (including the tag/version);
  no terminating `/` is required
- from the release, check the SHA & file names
- compare the SHA sums with those shown by `cat *.sha`
- check the executable names
- commit all changes, use a message like
  _**package.json: update urls for { customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }.{ customField('npmSubversion') } release**_ (without _v_)

### Publish on the npmjs.com server

- select the `xpack-development` branch
- check the latest commits `npm run git-log`
- update `CHANGELOG.md`, add a line like _**\* v{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') } published on npmjs.com**_
- commit with a message like _**CHANGELOG: publish npm v{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }.{ customField('npmSubversion') }**_
- `npm pack` and check the content of the archive, which should list
  only the `package.json`, the `README.md`, `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md`;
  possibly adjust `.npmignore`
- <code><b>npm version { customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }.{ customField('npmSubversion') }</b></code>; the first 4 numbers are the same as the
  GitHub release; the fifth number is the npm specific version
- the commits and the tag should have been pushed by the `postversion` script;
  if not, push them with `git push origin --tags` to GitHub
- **`npm publish --tag next`** (use `npm publish --access public`
  when publishing for the first time; add the `next` tag)

After a few moments the version will be visible at:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc?activeTab=versions

### Test if the binaries can be installed with xpm

Run the xPack action

- **`trigger-workflow-test-xpm`**

This will install the package via `xpm install` on all supported platforms.

The tests results are available from the
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/actions/) page.

### Tag the npm package as `latest`

When the release is considered stable, promote it as `latest`:

- <code>npm dist-tag ls @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc</code>
- <code>npm dist-tag add @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }.{ customField('npmSubversion') } latest</code>
- <code>npm dist-tag ls @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc</code>

In case the previous version is not functional and needs to be unpublished:

- <code>npm unpublish @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@{ customField('upstreamVersion') }-{ customField('xpackSubversion') }.{ customField('npmSubversion') }</code>

### Update the repo & publish the website

- merge `xpack-development` into `xpack`
- push the `xpack` branch to GitHub

At this moment the website is also generated.

- the result is in https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/blog/
- remember the post URL, since it must be updated in the release page

### Create the final GitHub release

- go to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/releases/) page
- check the download counter, it should match the number of tests
- add a link to the Web blog `[Continue reading »]()`; use an same blog URL
- remove the _tests only_ notice
- **disable** the **pre-release** button
- click the **Update Release** button

### Check SourceForge mirror

- https://sourceforge.net/projects/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/files/

## Cleanups

### Remove the pre-release binaries

- go to https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/pre-releases/releases/tag/test/
- remove the test binaries

### Clean the work area

Run the xPack action

  - **`trigger-workflow-deep-clean`**

This will remove the build folders on all self-hosted runners.

The results are available from the
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/actions/) page.
