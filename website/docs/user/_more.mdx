## Miscellaneous

### XML parsing in GDB

Some advanced GDB servers, like the one provided with SEGGER J-Link, are
capable of passing an XML with the target capabilities to the GDB client.
For unknown reasons, the Arm toolchain distribution came without XML
parsing support. The xPack distribution brings back support for
XML parsing and full integration with the SEGGER J-Link GDB server.

### Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
a separate binary, `arm-none-eabi-gdb-py3` with
support for **Python {customField('python_version')}**.

The Python 3 run-time is included, so GDB does not need any version of
Python to be installed, and is insensitive to the presence of other
versions.

Support for Python 2 was discontinued.

### Text User Interface (TUI)

Support for TUI was added to GDB. The `ncurses` library was added to
the distribution.

:::note

TUI is not available on Windows

:::

### No Guile

Due to the difficulties of building standalone Guile libraries on all
platforms, support for Guile scripting in GDB is currently not available.

## Using arm-none-eabi-gcc in testing
