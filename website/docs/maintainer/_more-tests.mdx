- check version:

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`.../arm-none-eabi-${ customField('upstreamVersion') }-${ customField('xpackSubversion') }/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
arm-none-eabi-gcc (xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC x86_64) ${ customField('upstreamVersion') }

- in a separate workspace, Import → General → Existing Projects into Workspace
  the Eclipse projects available in the
  `tests/eclipse` folder of the build repo; more details in the
  [README.md](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/tests/eclipse/README.md)
- in Preferences... → MCU, define the **Workspace Arm Toolchain path** to use
  the `Downloads` temporary location
- to test the compiler: for all projects (start with `arm-f4b-fs-lib`)
  - remove all build folders, or **Clean all**
  - build all configs, with the hammer, not with **Build all**, to be sure
    errors are not missed
- to test the debugger: for all QEMU debug configurations (start with
  `arm-f4b-fs-debug-lto-qemu`)
  - start the QEMU debug session,
  - single step a few lines (Step Over)
  - start continuous run (Resume)
  - halt (Suspend)
  - start (Resume)
  - stop (Terminate)
  - (don't miss the LTO cases, since in the past they had problems)
- to test the Python debugger, start it with `--version`

### Re-enable multi-lib, build and test again

Once the simple build passed tests, enable multi-lib and rerun:

- comment out `XBB_APPLICATION_WITHOUT_MULTILIB` in `application.sh`
- commit and push the `xpack-development` branch to the repo
- go back to [Manually trigger the build GitHub Actions](#manually-trigger-the-build-github-actions), build and test again.
