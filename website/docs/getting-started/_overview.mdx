:::info

In this context, _**embedded**_ refers exclusively to **bare-metal** systems,
not embedded Linux, which necessitates a different toolchain for building
Linux user space applications.

:::

GNU Arm Embedded GCC is the **arm-none-eabi** cross-compiler variant of
[Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain),
an open source project based on
the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org),
maintained by the
[Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org).

:::info

This project covers only the 32-bit variant of the Arm toolchain.
For the 64-bit, please see the related
[xPack GNU AArch64 Embedded GCC](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/aarch64-none-elf-gcc-xpack/)
project.
