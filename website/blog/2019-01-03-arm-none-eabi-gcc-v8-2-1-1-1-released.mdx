Version **8.2.1-1.1** is a new release of **GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC**.

<!-- truncate -->

<p><a href={frontMatter.download_url}>Binary files Â»</a></p>

## Deprecated

Use v8.2.1-1.6.

## Compliance

This release follows the official
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
**8-2018-q4-major** release from December 20, 2018 and it is based on the
`gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2018-q4-major-src.tar.bz2` source invariant.

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bit),
and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.

The macOS binary was built on a macOS 10.10.5 and must run on any newer
macOS system.

The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably
recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

The toolchain is also available as an
[xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc)
and can be conveniently installed with
[`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```sh
xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

This installs the latest available version.

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker containers;
all files required during builds are available as a separate
[gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build)
project.

## Known problems

The latest Binutils, also used in Arm Embedded GCC, have a problem when running on 32-bit machines, and `objdump` fails to generate .hex files. The bug affects both Windows and GNU/Linux machines. 64-bit builds are not affected. The bug is documented as [1810274](https://bugs.launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+bug/1810274).

The current solution is to upgrade to 8.2.1-1.2; the workaround is to
override `arm-none-eabi-objdump` with an older binary.
