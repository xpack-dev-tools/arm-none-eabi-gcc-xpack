The [xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64),
**macOS** (x64, arm64)
and **GNU/Linux** (x64, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Prerequisites

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC generally follows the official
[Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads/) releases.

The current version is based on:

- [Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads/)
release **{frontMatter.arm_version}** from {frontMatter.arm_date}
and uses the same sources. It includes:
  - GCC {frontMatter.gcc_version}
  - binutils {frontMatter.binutils_version}
  - newlib {frontMatter.newlib_version}
  - GDB {frontMatter.gdb_version}

## Supported libraries

## Changes

Compared to the official Arm version, there should be no functional changes.

### XML parsing in GDB

Some advanced GDB servers, like the one provided with SEGGER J-Link, are
capable of passing an XML with the target capabilities to the GDB client.
For unknown reasons, the Arm toolchain distribution came without XML
parsing support. The xPack distribution brings back support for
XML parsing and full integration with the SEGGER J-Link GDB server.

### Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
a separate binary, `arm-none-eabi-gdb-py3` with
support for **Python {frontMatter.python_version}**.

The Python 3 run-time is included, so GDB does not need any version of
Python to be installed, and is insensitive to the presence of other
versions.

Support for Python 2 was discontinued.

### Text User Interface (TUI)

Support for TUI was added to GDB. The `ncurses` library was added to
the distribution.

:::note

TUI is not available on Windows

:::

### No Guile

Due to the difficulties of building standalone Guile libraries on all
platforms, support for Guile scripting in GDB is currently not available.

## Bug fixes

- [[#33](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/issues/33)]
  due to a an issue in the build scripts, on GNU/Linux,
  the `arm-none-eabi-gdb` was built without ELF support; fixed

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- none

## Documentation

The original GNU GCC documentation is available
[online](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/).

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were tested on a variety of platforms,
but mainly to check the integrity of the
build, not the compiler functionality.

## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit x86 GNU/Linux and x86 Windows was
dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm GNU/Linux (armv7l) will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### GNU/Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 was dropped in 2022 and the
minimum requirement was raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18, Debian 10 and RedHat 8.

## Pre-deprecation notice for Ubuntu 18.04

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS _Bionic Beaver_ reached the end of the standard five-year
maintenance window for Long-Term Support (LTS) release on 31 May 2023.

As a courtesy, the xPack GNU/Linux releases will continue to be based on
Ubuntu 18.04 for another year.

From 2025 onwards, the GNU/Linux binaries will be built on **Debian 10**,
(**GLIBC 2.28**), and are also expected to run on RedHat 8.

Users are urged to update their build and test infrastructure to
ensure a smooth transition to the next xPack releases.
