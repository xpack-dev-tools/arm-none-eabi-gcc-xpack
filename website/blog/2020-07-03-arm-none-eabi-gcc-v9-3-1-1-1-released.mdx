Version 9.3.1-1.1 is a new release of **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC**, following Arm release from June 01, 2020 (version **9-2020-q2-update**). This is also the first release that **adds support for running on Arm platforms**, like **Raspberry Pi**.

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

This is the **xPack** distribution of the
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm).

There are separate binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and
**GNU/Linux**, 32/64-bit.

Starting with this version, support for 32/64-bit **Arm GNU/Linux** platforms,
like **Raspberry Pi**, was added.

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** on
various platforms can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

This release follows the official
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
**{frontMatter.arm_version}** release {frontMatter.arm_date} and it is based on the
`gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2020-q2-update-src.tar.bz2` source invariant.

For more details see the original Arm release text files:

- `distro-info/arm-readme.txt`
- `distro-info/arm-release.txt`

## Supported libraries

## Bug fixes

- none

## Changes

There should be no functional changes.

Starting with 9.x, the new archives are created with
a single folder named `xpack-arm-none-eabi-gcc-9.3.1-1.1` instead of
the hierarchical `xPacks/arm-none-eabi-gcc/9.3.1-1.1`. This internal
folder name is used consistently on all platforms. The archive extension
was changed to `.tar.gz`.

With these changes, the archives can now be used directly in other
development environments (like Arduino), without having to repack them.

## Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
two separate binaries,
`arm-none-eabi-gdb-py` with Python 2.7 support, and `arm-none-eabi-gdb-py3` with
support for Python 3.7.

It is mandatory to have **exactly** those versions installed, otherwise
GDB will not start properly.

For this it is recommended to install the binaries provided by
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
not those available in the distribution, since they may be incomplete, for
example those in Ubuntu/Debian, which split the Python system library into
multiple packages.

On GNU/Linux, the recommended way is to build is from sources, and
install locally:

```bash
python3_version="3.7.9"
mkdir -p "${HOME}/Downloads"
curl -L --fail -o "${HOME}/Downloads/Python-${python3_version}.tgz" https://www.python.org/ftp/python/${python3_version}/Python-${python3_version}.tgz
rm -rf "${HOME}/Work/Python-${python3_version}"
mkdir -p "${HOME}/Work"
cd "${HOME}/Work"
tar xzf "${HOME}/Downloads/Python-${python3_version}.tgz"
cd "${HOME}/Work/Python-${python3_version}"
bash ./configure --prefix="${HOME}/opt"
make
make altinstall
```

To run GDB with this version of Python, use a script to set the proper
environment, like:

```bash
mkdir -p "${HOME}/opt/bin"
cat <<'__EOF__' > "${HOME}/opt/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb-py3.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
PYTHONPATH="$($HOME/opt/bin/python3.7 -c 'import os; import sys; print(os.pathsep.join(sys.path))')" \
PYTHONHOME="$($HOME/opt/bin/python3.7 -c 'import sys; print(sys.prefix)')" \
arm-none-eabi-gdb-py3 "$@"
__EOF__
chmod +x "${HOME}/opt/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb-py3.sh"
```

## Text User Interface (TUI)

Support for TUI was added to GDB. The `ncurses` library (v6.2) was added to
the distribution.

:::note

TUI is not available on Windows

:::

## Known problems

- the GDB binaries with Python support were built with version 2.7/3.7,
 and require exactly those versions in order to run properly;
- C++ exceptions in the non-nano libraries are not caught; fixed in
 9.3.1-1.2.

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- x64 macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Build

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## Travis tests

The first set of tests were performed on Travis, by running
a simple script to check if the binaries start and compile several simple
programs on a wide range of platforms and distributions:

- [test xPack Arm Embed GCC on stable platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/builds/704528867)
- [test xPack Arm Embed GCC on latest platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/builds/704562965)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.13.

The tests consist in building and debugging some
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by Arm, the
long and complex tests performed by Arm to validate their release were not
executed again.
