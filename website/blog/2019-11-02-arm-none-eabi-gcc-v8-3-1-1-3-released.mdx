`} </CodeBlock>

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** on
various platforms can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

This release follows the official
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
**8-2019-q3-update** release from July 10, 2019 and it is based on the
`gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2019-q3-update-src.tar.bz2` source invariant.

For more details see the original Arm release text files:

- `distro-info/arm-readme.txt`

## Bug fixes

- [[#4]](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/issues/4)
Due to a bug in the build scripts, the Windows `gdb-py` had a hard-wired
dependency to Python 2.7.13 and failed to start on other versions; fixed;
- [[#3]](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/issues/3)
Due to a bug in the build scripts, the macOS `gdb-py` had a wrong
dependency and failed to start; fixed;
- [[#2]](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/issues/2)
Due to a bug in the build scripts, the Windows binaries included two
copies of the `docs` folder, one in root and one in the `share` folder;
the script was fixed and now there is only one copy in `share/docs`.
- [[#1]](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/issues/1)
Due to an omission in the build scripts, the content of the `libgcov`
library was mostly empty; the script was fixed and now the library has the
expected content.

## Changes

There should be no functional changes.

### `lib/bdf-plugins`

To improve LTO support, the `lib/bdf-plugins` folder was added, with
a link to the `liblto_plugin.so` library (a file copy on Windows).

This allows the use of traditional program names, like `arm-none-eabi-ar`
instead of the new `arm-none-eabi-gcc-ar`, without getting errors like:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-ar -r  "libarm-static-lib.a"  ./lib.o
arm-none-eabi-ar: creating libarm-static-lib.a
arm-none-eabi-ar: ./lib.o: plugin needed to handle lto object <---
```

The issue was reported to Arm as bug [1838049](https://bugs.launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+bug/1838049).

### Python 3

Partial experimental support for Python 3 was added to GDB for GNU/Linux
and macOS; not yet available on Windows
([24469](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24469)).

## Known problems

- [[#5]](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/issues/5)
the `arm-none-eabi-gdb-py` fails to start on Ubuntu (and possibly
other Debian) systems, it fails with a message like:
```console
$ PYTHONHOME=/usr PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.7 arm-none-eabi-gdb-py --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py", line 554, in <module>
    main()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py", line 536, in main
    known_paths = addusersitepackages(known_paths)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py", line 272, in addusersitepackages
    user_site = getusersitepackages()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py", line 247, in getusersitepackages
    user_base = getuserbase() # this will also set USER_BASE
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py", line 237, in getuserbase
    USER_BASE = get_config_var('userbase')
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py", line 587, in get_config_var
    return get_config_vars().get(name)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py", line 533, in get_config_vars
    _init_posix(_CONFIG_VARS)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py", line 417, in _init_posix
    from _sysconfigdata import build_time_vars
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/_sysconfigdata.py", line 6, in <module>
    from _sysconfigdata_nd import *
ImportError: No module named _sysconfigdata_nd
```

The problem is caused by gdb-py not being able to locate the Python
system libraries, split into multiple packages and installed in multiple
folders.

The workaround is to pass the Python environment to gdb-py:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="$(python -c 'import os; import sys; print(os.pathsep.join(sys.path))')" \
PYTHONHOME="$(python -c 'import sys; print(sys.prefix)')"
```

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a CentOS 6
  Docker container
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 7.4, running in a
  CentOS 6 Docker container
- x64 macOS: most binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5; GDB cannot be compiled with GCC, so Apple
  clang was used.

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.13.

The tests consist in building and debugging some
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by Arm, the
long and complex tests performed by Arm to validate their release were not
executed again.
