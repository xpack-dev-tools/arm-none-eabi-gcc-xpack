## Deprecated

Use v8.2.1-1.6.

## Compliance

This release follows the official
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
**8-2018-q4-major** release from December 20, 2018 and it is based on the
`gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2018-q4-major-src.tar.bz2` source invariant.

## Changes

Compared to the ARM distribution, the build procedure is more or less the
same and there should be no functional differences, except the following
bug fixes:

- a patch was applied to binutils to fix the 32-bit objcopy bug
  [24065](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24065)
- GDB was built the Git commit ad0f979c9 from 2019-01-29, to fix the bugs
  affecting C++ LTO projects
  [24145](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24145)
- the `-static` option was removed from the Windows build, to allow for
  the `liblto_plugin-0.dll` to be created; the `libwinpthread-1.dll` was
  copied to the `bin` folder
- the `liblto_plugin` copied/linked to the `lib/bdf-plugins` for `ar`
  to find it and be able to process archives with LTO objects.

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bit),
and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.

The macOS binary was built on a macOS 10.10.5 and must run on any newer
macOS system.

The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably
recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

The toolchain is also available as an
[xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc)
and can be conveniently installed with
[`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```sh
xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc@latest
```

This installs the latest available version.

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker containers;
all files required during builds are available as a separate
[gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build)
project.

## Known problems

### LTO & debugging on Windows

The Arm 8-2018-q4-major release introduced a problem on Windows, enabling
debugging information (`-g`/`-g3`) prevents `-flto` to properly link.
For Release configurations it is not a problem to remove the debug
options, but for Debug configurations this is unusable. The workaround
is to revert to the previous 7-2018-q2-update release, or to temporarily disable `-flto`. ([89183](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=89183))

### LTO & paths with spaces on Windows

When installing on Windows in locations with spaces in folder names,
the link step fails for builds using LTO.
