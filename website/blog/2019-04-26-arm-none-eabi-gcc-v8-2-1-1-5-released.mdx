## Deprecated

Use v8.2.1-1.6.

## Compliance

This release follows the official
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
**8-2018-q4-major** release from December 20, 2018 and it is based on the
`gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2018-q4-major-src.tar.bz2` source invariant.

## Changes

Compared to the ARM distribution, the build procedure is more or less the
same and there should be no functional differences, except the following
bug fixes:

- [Issue:[#3](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build/issues/3)]
  due to a problem in the GCC configure script and the specifics of the static
  build, LTO was not effective on Windows, and the initial workaround proved
  not effective either; in the new build environment the configure script is
  enables LTO and it is functional on windows too;
- a patch was applied to binutils to fix the 32-bit objcopy bug
  [24065](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24065)
- GDB was built the Git commit ad0f979c9 from 2019-01-29, to fix the bugs
  affecting C++ LTO projects
  [24145](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24145)
- [Issue:[#3](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build/issues/3)]
  by default, the GCC build script fails to create `liblto_plugin-0.dll`
  for static builds with mingw; builds are now using shared libraries
- [Issue:[#1](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build/issues/1)]
  the `liblto_plugin` copied/linked to the `lib/bdf-plugins` for `ar`
  to find it and be able to process archives with LTO objects
- a patch was applied to gcc to fix the Windows LTO with -g bug
  [89183](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=89183)
- a patch was applied to gcc to fix the Windows paths with spaces bug
  [89249](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=89249)

## Python 3

Experimental support was added for Python 3 in GDB. Unfortunately compiling
GDB with mingw-w64 requires an update to the new Python 3
API, not yet available at the moment of this release.

Also support for 32-bit machines might not be fully functional.

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bit),
and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.

The macOS binary was built on a macOS 10.10.5 and must run on any newer
macOS system.

The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably
recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

The toolchain is also available as an
[xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc)
and can be conveniently installed with
[`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```sh
xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc@latest
```

This installs the latest available version.

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker containers;
all files required during builds are available as a separate
[gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build)
project.

## Known problems

### Windows paths with spaces

Installing the toolchain in locations which use spaces in the path is still problematic.

Temporarily move the toolchain to paths which do not use spaces, or, even better, install it via `xpm`, which uses safe paths.
