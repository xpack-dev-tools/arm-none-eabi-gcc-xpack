Version **7.3.1-1.1** is a new release of **GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC**.

<!-- truncate -->

## Compliance

This release follows the official
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
**7-2018-q2-update** release from June 27, 2018 and it is based on the
`gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2018-q2-update-src.tar.bz2` source invariant.

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bit),
and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.

The macOS binary was built on a macOS 10.10.5 and must run on any newer
macOS system.

The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably
recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

The toolchain is also available as an
[xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc)
and can be conveniently installed with
[`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```sh
xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

This installs the latest available version.

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker containers;
all files required during builds are available as a separate
[gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build)
project.

## Known problems

* due to some changes in newlib, the definition of the `_EXFUN` macro changed
and the semihosting projects fail to build with a compile error in
`system/src/newlib/_syscalls.c`. The problem is in the project template, and
a fix will be available in the next release of GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins
[#317](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/317).
