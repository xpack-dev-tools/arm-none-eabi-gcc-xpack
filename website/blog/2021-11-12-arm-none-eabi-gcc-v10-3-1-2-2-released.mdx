[The xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (Intel 32/64-bit),
**macOS** (Intel 64-bit) and **GNU/Linux** (Intel 32/64-bit, Arm 32/64-bit).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={ frontMatter.download_url }>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Prerequisites

- Intel GNU/Linux 32/64-bit: any system with **GLIBC 2.15** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 12 or later, Debian 8 or later, RedHat/CentOS 7 later,
  Fedora 20 or later, etc)
- Arm GNU/Linux 32/64-bit: any system with **GLIBC 2.23** or higher

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** on various platforms
are presented in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC generally follows the official
[Arm Embedded GCC](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/downloads/) releases.

The current version is based on:

- [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
release **{ frontMatter.arm_version }** from { frontMatter.arm_date } and uses the
`gcc-arm-none-eabi-{ frontMatter.arm_version }-src.tar.bz2` source invariant.
It includes:
  - GCC 10.3.1
  - binutils 2.36
  - newlib 4.1.0
  - GDB 10.2

For more details see the original Arm release text files:

- `distro-info/arm-readme.txt`
- `distro-info/arm-release.txt`

## Supported libraries

## Changes

Compared to the Arm version, there should be no functional changes.

Compared to 10.3.1-2.2, this release uses a new version of the
build scripts, which provide a better control over the content of the
binary objects, and thus is able to further optimize the size of
the libraries, resulting in slightly smaller archives.

### Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
a separate binary, `arm-none-eabi-gdb-py3` with
support for **Python 3.7**.

The Python 3 run-time is included, so GDB does not need any version of
Python to be installed, and is insensitive to the presence of other
versions.

Support for Python 2 was discontinued.

### Text User Interface (TUI)

Support for TUI was added to GDB. The `ncurses` library (v6.2) was added to
the distribution.

:::note

TUI is not available on Windows

## Documentation

The original documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and Intel & Arm GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were tested on a variety of platforms,
but mainly to check the integrity of the
build, not the compiler functionality.

```

## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit Intel Linux and Intel Windows will most probably
be dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm Linux will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 will most probably be dropped in 2022, and the
minimum requirement will be raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18 and RedHat 8.
