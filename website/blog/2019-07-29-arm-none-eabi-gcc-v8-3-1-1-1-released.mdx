The full details of installing the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** on
various platforms can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

This release follows the official
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
**8-2019-q3-update** release from July 10, 2019 and it is based on the
`gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2019-q3-update-src.tar.bz2` source invariant.

## Changes

There should be no functional changes.

### `lib/bdf-plugins`

To improve LTO support, the `lib/bdf-plugins` folder was added, with
a link to the `liblto_plugin.so` library (a file copy on Windows).

This allows the use of traditional program names, like `arm-none-eabi-ar`
instead of the new `arm-none-eabi-gcc-ar`, without getting errors like:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-ar -r  "libarm-static-lib.a"  ./lib.o
arm-none-eabi-ar: creating libarm-static-lib.a
arm-none-eabi-ar: ./lib.o: plugin needed to handle lto object <---
```

The issue was reported to Arm as bug [1838049](https://bugs.launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+bug/1838049).

### Python 3

Partial experimental support for Python 3 was added to GDB for GNU/Linux
and macOS; not yet available on Windows
([24469](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24469)).

## Known problems

- [[#1]](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/issues/1)
  Due to an omission in the build scripts, the content of the `libgcov`
  library is mostly empty; the problem was fixed starting with v8.3.1-1.2.

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a CentOS 6
  Docker container
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 7.4, running in a
  CentOS 6 Docker container
- x64 macOS: most binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5; GDB cannot be compiled with GCC, so Apple
  clang was used.

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.13.

The tests consist in building and debugging some
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by Arm, the
long and complex tests performed by Arm to validate their release were not
executed again.
