# The xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC

A standalone cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux) **GNU Arm Embedded GCC**
binary distribution, intended for reproducible builds.

In addition to the the binary archives and the package meta data,
this project also includes the build scripts.

## Overview

This open source project is hosted on GitHub as
[`xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack)
and provides the platform specific binaries for the
[xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/).

The binaries can be installed automatically as **binary xPacks** or manually as
**portable archives**.

## Release schedule

This distribution plans to follow the official
[Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads/)
distribution, by Arm.

## User info

This section is intended as a shortcut for those who plan
to use the GNU Arm Embedded GCC binaries. For full details please read the
[xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/) pages.

### Easy install

The easiest way to install GNU Arm Embedded GCC is using the **binary xPack**, available as
[`@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

#### Prerequisites

A recent [xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/),
which is a portable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application
that complements [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com)
with several extra features specific to
**C/C++ projects**.

It is recommended to install/update to the latest version with:

```sh
npm install --location=global xpm@latest
```

For details please follow the instructions in the
[xPack install](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

#### Install

With the `xpm` tool available, installing
the latest version of the package and adding it as
a development dependency for a project is quite easy:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Add a package.json if not already present

xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@latest --verbose

ls -l xpacks/.bin
```

This command will:

- install the latest available version,
into the central xPacks store, if not already there
- add symbolic links to the central store
(or `.cmd` forwarders on Windows) into
the local `xpacks/.bin` folder.

The central xPacks store is a platform dependent
location in the home folder;
check the output of the `xpm` command for the actual
folder used on your platform.
This location is configurable via the environment variable
`XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER`; for more details please check the
[xpm folders](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/folders/) page.

For xPacks aware tools, like the **Eclipse Embedded C/C++ plug-ins**,
it is also possible to install GNU Arm Embedded GCC globally, in the user home folder:

```sh
xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@latest --verbose
```

Eclipse will automatically
identify binaries installed with
`xpm` and provide a convenient method to manage paths.

After install, the package should create a structure like this (macOS files;
only the first two depth levels are shown):

#### Uninstall

To remove the links created by xpm in the current project:

```sh
cd my-project

xpm uninstall @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

To completely remove the package from the central xPack store:

```sh
xpm uninstall --global @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

### Manual install

For all platforms, the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC**
binaries are released as portable
archives that can be installed in any location.

The archives can be downloaded from the
GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/releases/)
page.

For more details please read the
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/install/) page.

### Versioning

The version strings used by the GCC project are three number strings
like `13.2.1`; to this string the xPack distribution adds a four number,
as the Arm version,
but since semver allows only three numbers, all additional ones can
be added only as pre-release strings, separated by a dash,
like `13.2.1-1.1`. The fifth number is the xPack release.
When published as a npm package, the version gets
a sixth number, like `13.2.1-1.1.1`.

Since adherence of third party packages to semver is not guaranteed,
it is recommended to use semver expressions like `^13.2.1` and `~13.2.1`
with caution, and prefer exact matches, like `13.2.1-1.1.1`.
